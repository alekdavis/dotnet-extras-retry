# DotNetExtras.RetryLibDemo project
This project implements a console application with the code samples illustrating how to use the `DotNetExtras.Retry` library APIs for retrying failed operation. The samples cover three most common scenarios:

1. Retrying an operation a number of times.
1. Retrying an operation within the specified timeout.
1. Retrying an operation after reloading the application configuration.

For more details, read the source code comments.
